git init - make repo
rm -rf	.git - delete repo
rm -fr .git

To delete files from online repo:
git rm --cached file.txt
git commit
git push origin main

To commit modified files to a new branch:
git branch -M [branch]
git commit -a
git push

To get changes from modifications to files others made or new files:
git pull

How to do it generally without conflict:
1.Make your change.
2.git commit -a (this temporarily stores your change)
3.git pull (this will let you know if the repo file has been changed before pushing)
4.Resolve (merge editor will pop up in vscode) rewrite the code there
5.git commit 
6.git push



Add files from any folder to repo
git remote add origin https #gets to you to master repo
1. git branch -M "main" #takes you to "main" branch (you can add branches this way)
2. git add [file]
3. git commit (popup)
4. git push origin "main" #pushes to main

git clone [repo]
cd [directory of repo] - (main)
git add donut.c
git commit -m donut.c
git push origin main 

what works on my uni account: BEST
git clone [repo] + cd [directory of repo] - (main)
Or git remote add origin [repo] + git branch -M main
Once you're in the main branch, you can add individual files
git add donut.c
git commit -m donut.c
git push origin main


Alternative(several files in one commit)
git add blah1
git add blah2
git add blah3
git commit (pop up, write commit)
git push

create a copy of main branch in another branch
git branch -M blah
git push origin blah	

Convieniant
1.You can right click on the directory to get straight to it
2.You can enter commands in bash in vscode terminal with the code to the side
3.You can bash in vscode in a random folder, asign it the link with remote add origin then start committing shit
